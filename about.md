<p>I have a great fascination about engineering so I have become an electrical and electronic engineer.
My strength includes willingness to learn and grow with sincerity, honesty, dedication, result oriented, and patient enough to work for a long time.</p>
<p>I have the necessary skills for engineering work related to my field. I am organized, resourceful, personable and a fast learner.</p>
<p>Specially I have "Can do attitude".</p>
<p>Various kind of sports, travelling, music, hanging out is my part of interest.
I believe, life is short so we should try to do things for bigger memory!.</p>
