<p>I have completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. I have a great fascination about engineering and always try to learn new things around the world. I try my best to be punctual, loyal and honest.
I believe, life is short so we should try to do things for bigger memory!
I love traveling, listening music, cricket,football and other indoor games.</p>
