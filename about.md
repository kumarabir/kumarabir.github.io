<p>I have completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. I have a great fascination about engineering and always try to learn new things around the world. I try my best to be punctual, loyal and honest.
I believe, life is short so we should try to do things for bigger memory! .</p>

<p> My undergraduate thesis topic was,"Design and economic analysis of pv-biogas-diesel generator hybrid system for Nijhum Dwip in Bangladesh". </p>
